thurgies we mag call the normal ollices ol that lamilp3 the others,

both in MSS. and printed editions, commende with ‘The Preger ol the
lliss ol Peaee,' the pretore to the anaphora.¹) Thus, though in the pre-
sent chapter l shall have occasion to mention some sixty hiturgies, i. e.

anaphoras, we shall aotlind above twelve ollices which contain a sepa-
* rate proanaplroral portion. l now proceed to a consideration ol the Li·
. turgies ol the East, or the Nestorians. t ’

'l'here are three ol these3 that ol the Apostles S. Adaeus and S.
Naris, that ol Nestorius, and that ol 'theodore the Interpreter. Now that
ol Nestorius is, in part, older than the Couneil ol Ephesus, (A. u. 431,)
lor it is certain that alter that period the Nestorians would not have
adopted any rite lrom Constantinople. Bur either lrom that, or lrom the
Liturgy ol S. Basil, one remarkable expression is derived3 alter the prayer
ol invocation, or the petition that the bread and wine may, hy the ope-
ration ol the Houv Gnnsr, become the Bady and Elood ol our Lono Ja-
sus Cnnrsr, the Caesarean and constantinopolitan rites add, what is un·
y known to that ol S. lantes, “changing them by the Hoav Gnosr.” This
occurs in no other lorrn but the Armenian, and therelore proves thetae
that, so the Nestorian, must have been derived lrom Constantinople, ἰ. a.
must have a groundworlt earlier than 431. More especially is this the

, uase in the expression l have just quoted, because the views ol the Ne-

storians respecting tlte Holy Eucharist bave been, since the time ol the
arch-heretis to the present day, lamentably low, and therefore never
would bave led them to use the phrase mentioned above, unless there
had been some strong inlluence in its favour. Once let this be granted,
that the frameworlt ol the [itnrgy ol Nestorius is ol the date lbave just
assigned to it, and it matters not, lor my argument, how much, iu the
lapse oi ages, it hasbeen altered. Now it is certain that when theNe-
storians, alter their condemnation in the Couneil ol Ephesus, and subse-
quently hg the Emperor, sought, in great numbers, an asylum in Persia,
they must have lortnd a Liturgy ol some sort established there. And there
is every appearance that the Liturgy ol the Apostles, as we now have it,

ι. was, to all intents and purposes, that iorrn.

For the office of Nestorius borrows hom it the proanaphoral por·
tion3 and therefore it follows that, in tlte earlier part ol the hlthceutury,
the Litargy ol the Apostles was ol old established use in the East. lts
very name ol S. Adaeus (or S. Thaddaens) shows its Persian origiua
strangers would never have so called it, nor il they bad, could they have
