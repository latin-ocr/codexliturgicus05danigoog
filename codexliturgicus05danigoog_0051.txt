lanus, probably, as l bare said, one ol the oldest now extant lt is
still said in many chorches ol Greece on the tara ol October, which is,
in the Eastem Choreb, the Festival ol S. lomes. urum this Greek Li·
turgy there are three sets os olisboots.

The first ol these is tho Caesarean branch. S. anrn’s Liturgy is
a recast cl S. Jnuus’, as S. Cnnvsosrou’s is an abbreviation aud new
edition ol S. Rasil’s. From S. Basil's spraog the kaurno-Gnsconmu rite,
as at present used3 while S. Cnursosrorr’s exercised an induence ou the
later forms ol the Nestorians. circumstances hare rendered the Constan-
. tinopolitan rites, as l bave already said, sole possessors ol the Ortbodox
Eost. Tho Liturgy ol S. Basil is said on all Sundays in Laut, except
Palm Sunday‚ on llaundy Thursday, Easter Ere, the Vigil ol Christmas
. and the Epiphany, and the least ol S. casn, (Jow. 1.) Tuae ol S. Chry-
sostom is appropriated to every other day in the year. The latter, in
tbelluchologies, invariably precedes the tormer3 and serves as, dc sacto,
its normal torm.

'l'he second ollshoot ol S. Jonas is ol lar less importance. lt em-
braces but two olsrces: the Sicilian Liturgy, which was first published,
though in a very imperfect state, by Asseman: the other named from S.
Cyril, which was never used widely, and ol which it is impossible to say
where it was employed. 'l'he Sicilian Liturgy dillers principally from that
ol S. James in amplification: though it contains a remarkable explanation
ol the prayers for Saints ollcred by the Eastern Choreb at the Altar,
and seems intended to approximate to the then received Latin doctrine.
The date ol this Liturgy is earlier than 984. 'l'he clbce ot S. Cyril is
variously argued to hare been merely one ol tbe numerous Syro-Jaco-
bite Liturgios, cr the rite ol some Orthodox Cburch dependent on Jeru-
salem. l incline to the latter opinion.

'l'he third offshccr ol the Hierosolymitan office is the Srmac Liturgy
ol S. liuns, and its dependeots. lt dillers verbally from the Greek office
ol the same name, from which itis derived. The prayers are, generally
speaking, rather shorter3 though the luvocation ol the Honv Gnosr is
’ much amplilied. lt is remarkable lor having two pro-anaphoral forms,
both comparativcly late and valuclcss: and these arethe norms olall
(ΧΗ) Syro-Jacobite Liturgies. —- ·-
