imposed on the inhabitants oi that country a iorm ol which they had

Ι never heard, under the name ol the illuminatore oi diat region. And vve'
ind that since the second century, and the Episcopate ol Schahluin, the
latholioate oi Seleucia had been ableto hold hut little intercourse vvith
the Christiana ol the Roman Empire; they must therefore either have
had the Liturgy ol S. tames, and alter the time oi their separation have
rejected it, and formed another office from their ovvn ianey3 or they must
hue had a primitive Liturgy irom their own Apostles, to which they
nedtuuy clung. But is it likely that this change could have tehen place,
vhen a great sehovd like that ol Edessa, existed, ready to notice and to
condemn itt ls it likely that no expressions ol an unsound nature should
lave hoen inserted in the substituted ollioes, shadowing lorth the hetero-
dox heliel ol its compilers, on the subject ol the lncarnation‘l Yet the
litnrgy oi the Apostles has not n taint ol Nestorianism‚ though (and it
uworthy oi notice) that ol Nestorius has. ls it likely that had such
a total change ol Liturgy tehen place among the Christiane ol the lar
dest, it should never have been cast in their teeth hy the opponente ol
Nestorianism?

Again, the Liturgy ol the Apostles differs lar more widely (es vve
shall herealter see) irom the other Liturgical ramilies, than any ol them
irone each other. lt hears every marl oi the remotest age3 it is simple,
sterm entirely unlike the pompona effusione ol later writers, and, from
its structure, evidently incapable ol being derived lrom any amplilication ·
or mange ol the edices ol' Caesarea or Jerusalem. Compare this vvith
the Liturgies ol another isolated Church. the Ethiopian3 thot has deve-
loped the normal Liturgy ol Copto-lacebite S. Basil into a strange ara-
besque vrorh ol· conceits. Why should not the Persicus have done the
nme tn their own normal rite, il they hed any besides that which they
now possess? ln one word, why should the East have rejected its pri·
mitive Liturgy? Why, it it did, should it not, in the new form, have
symbolized its doctrinal errorsi llovv could it preserve the severe sim-
plicity oi primitive times? Why was it never taunted with the change?

'l'he only ohjection which has been urged against the primitive an·
tiquity ol the Nestorian Liturgy, ie thus stated by hlr. Palmer: ¹) “Ephraem
Syrus, who lived at Edessa, the very centre ol 'Apostolical preaohing,
heiore the rise ol Nestorianism‚ gives an account nithe Liturgy, which
is totally at variance with all the Nestorian Liturgies. The three Nesto·
